                <h1>Culinary Cards</h1>
                <h2>A recipe website created as a school project for Developing the Interactive Web</h2>
                <h5>
                    This website in unfortunately hosted on Render.com. This means that the website takes some time to spin up.
                    The data in the database also is wiped every month due to it being a free service. Render.com is able to do this
                    by storing our git repository information. After some time of inactivity, the website will spin down and the data
                    will be wiped from their servers. This is a great service for hosting a website for free, but it is not ideal for
                    a website that needs to store data for long periods of time.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    The website is a recipe website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete recipes. The website is
                    built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website uses a Postgres SQL database to store the recipes. The backend
                    is hosted in Flask with a frontend css framework of PureCSS. 
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    This website was an excellant learning experience for me. I learned how to use a SQL database, how to use a backend
                    server, and how to use a frontend framework. I also learned how to use git to push and pull code from a repository as
                    well as dealing with merge conflicts and other git issues. The project heavily relied on my groups teamwork and
                    communication skills. We got to work together to create the website and make sure that we were all on the same page.
                    We had weekly meetings to discuss what we had done and what we were going to do. We also had a group chat to discuss
                    any issues that we were having. This project was a great learning experience for me and I am glad that I was able to
                    work on it with such an amazing team!

                <h1>Tailwind Demo</h1>
                <h2>An interactive tailwind demo going over the basics of Tailwind CSS.</h2>
                <h5>
                    This was a University project where my team and I needed to research a tech stack component and present it to the
                    class. My team and I chose to research Tailwind CSS. Upon researching Tailwind, we found that it was a utility-first
                    CSS framework that was easy to use and had a lot of features. We decided to create a demo website instead of a standard
                    presentation. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was hosted using ember.js. The website
                    was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to use a new CSS framework and how to use ember.js.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    The interactive website utilizes core ember.js concepts such as components and routes. The website is a great example
                    of the basics of using ember.js as well as providing real time renders of the HTML/tailwind code.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    My team and I worked together to create the website. We had weekly meetings to discuss what we had done and what we 
                    needed to improve. In the end we came together to record the presentation and my team member posted it on YouTube.

                <h1>Task Next</h1>
                <h2>A todo website utilizing Ember.js, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS.</h2>
                <h5>
                    This was a project done at the University of Minnesota as a personal assignment. The project was to create a todo
                    website using Ember.js, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. Task Next uses Ember.js's SPA framework to create a web application
                    that is functional and easy to use. The website uses Firebase to store the data and to authenticate users. Tailwind CSS
                    was used for all of the styling of the webapp. The webapp started as a fundamental project that didn't have any style
                    requirements, but the more I coded it the more I fell in love with it's overall design and functionality.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    There's plenty of features that I would like to add to the website in the future. I would like to more functionality with
                    how you can filter or sort tasks as well and a calendar option to view tasks by a designated period of time. This project
                    turned into a passion project and I am excited to see where it goes in the future.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    I've never worked with Ember.js or any type of SPA framework before this project. I learned a lot about how to use Ember.js
                    to render components and use tracked variables to have effective data binding. I also learned how to use Firebase to store data
                    as collections and documents. Firebase also offered authentication services that I used to authenticate users. Firebase is easy
                    to understand and the integration with github actions is seamless. I'm really happy I got to learn these new frameworks along
                    with my new found love for Tailwind CSS.
